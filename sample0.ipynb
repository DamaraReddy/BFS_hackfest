      " As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to real-time financial data or the ability to perform calculations. However, I can provide you with general steps on how to find or calculate the capital expenditure value for a company:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Access the company's financial statements: Obtain the latest financial statements of the company you are interested in. These statements typically include the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Look for capital expenditure details: Review the cash flow statement to find the section related to investing activities. Under investing activities, you will typically find the line item related to \"Purchases of property and equipment\" or \"Capital Expenditure.\" This line item represents the cash spent on acquiring fixed assets and intangible assets during a specific period.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Note the value for the desired period: Identify the specific reporting period (year and quarter) you are interested in and locate the corresponding value for capital expenditure.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Convert the value if necessary: The capital expenditure value is usually reported in millions or billions of dollars. If the value is reported in millions, you may need to multiply it by 1,000 to convert it to billions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that the specific steps may vary depending on the format and presentation of the financial statements. It's recommended to refer to the official financial reports or consult a financial professional to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.\n",
