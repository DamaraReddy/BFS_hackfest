Refin ing throughput volumes averaged \\n3.0 million barrels per day in the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n “Our refineries operated well and achieved 95 percent throughput capacity utilization, which is a \\ntestament to our team’ s relentless focus on operational excellence,” said Lane Riggs , Valero ’s \\nChief Ex ecutive Officer  and President . “Product demand remained strong in our U.S. wholesale \\nsystem, which matched the second quarter record of over 1 million barrels per day of sales volume .” \\n Renewable Diesel  \\nThe Renewable Diesel segment , which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel  joint venture  (DGD) , \\nreported $123 million of operating income for the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to $212 million \\nfor the third  quarter  of 2022. Segment s ales volumes averaged 3.0 million  gallons per day in the \\nthird  quarter  of 2023, which was 761 thousand gallons per day higher  than the third  quarter  of \\n2022. The higher  sales volumes w ere due to the impact of additional volumes from  the DGD Port \\n Arthur plant , which started up in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Operating income was lower than the \\nthird quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower renewable diesel margin in the third quarter of 2023.  \\n \\nEthanol  \\nThe Ethanol segment reported $197 million  of operating income  for the third  quarter  of 2023, \\ncompared to  $1 million for the third  quarter  of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged  \\n4.3 million gallons per day in the third  quarter  of 2023, which was 831 thousand gallons per day \\nhigher  than the third  quarter of 2022. Operating income was higher than the third quarter of 2022 \\nprimarily as a result of higher production volumes and lower corn prices in the third quarter of \\n2023.  \\n \\nCorporate and Other  \\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $250  million in the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to \\n$214 million in the third  quarter  of 2022. The effective tax rate for the third  quarter of 2023 was \\n23 percent . \\n Investing and Financing Activities  \\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion  in the third  quarter  of 2023. Included in \\nthis amount was a $33 million favorable change in  working capital and $82 million  of adjusted net \\ncash provided by operating activities associated with the other  joint venture member ’s share of \\nDGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion  \\nin the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n Capital investments totaled $394 million in the third  quarter  of 2023, of which $303 m illion  was \\nfor sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, cata lysts and regulatory compliance . \\nExcluding capital investments attributable to the other  joint venture member ’s share of DGD, \\ncapital investments attributable to Valero were $35 2 million . \\n \\nValero returned $2.2 billion to stockholders in the third  quarter of 2023, of which $360 million \\nwas paid as dividends and $1.8 billion was for the purchase of approximately 13 million shares of  common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 68 percent of adjusted net cash provided by operating \\nactivities .  \\n \\nValero continues to target an annual  payout ratio between 40 and 50 percent of adjusted net cash \\nprovided by operating activities. Valero defines payout ratio as the sum of dividends  paid and the \\ntotal cost of stock buybacks divided by net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for \\nchanges in working capital and DGD ’s net cash provided by operating activities, excluding \\nchanges in its working capital, attributable to the other joint venture member ’s share of  DGD.  \\n \\nLiquidity and Financial Position  \\nValero ended  the third  quarter of 2023 with $9.2 billion of total debt , $2.3 billion of  finance lease \\nobligations and $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents . The debt to capitalization ratio, net of  \\ncash and cash equivalents, was 17 percent  as of September  30, 2023.  \\n \\nStrategic Update  \\nThe Sustainable Aviation Fuel ( SAF) project at the DGD Port Arthur plant remains on schedule \\nand is expected to be completed in 2025 and cost $315 million, with half of that attributable to \\nValero . The project  is expected to  give the plant  the optionality  to upgrade approximately \\n50 percent of its current 470 million gallon renewable diesel annual production capacity  to SAF . \\nWith the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers \\nof SAF in the world.  \\n “While there ar e broader factors that may drive market  volatility , we remain  focused on things we \\ncan control ,” said Riggs , “including operating efficiently in a safe, reliable and environmentally \\nresponsible manner, maintaining capital discipline by adhering to a minimum return threshold on \\ngrowth projects, and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns .”  \\n \\nConference Call  \\nValero ’s senior management will hold a conference call at 10  a.m.  ET today to discuss this earnings \\nrelease and to provide an update on oper ations and strategy.

required to set \\nannual quotas for the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties, such as us, must blend into petroleum-based \\ntransportation fuels consumed in the U.S. The quotas are used to determine an obligated party’s RVO. The EPA released a \\nfinal rule on June  3, 2022 that, among other things, modified the volume standards for 2020 and, for the first time, \\nestablished volume standards for 2021 and 2022.\\nIn 2020, we recognized the cost of the RVO using the 2020 quotas set by the EPA at that time, and in 2021 and the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized the cost of the RVO using our estimates of the quotas. As a result of the \\nfinal rule released by the EPA as noted above, we recognized a benefit of $104 million in the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 primarily related to the modification of the 2020 quotas.\\n(b)Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 includes a gain of $23 million on the \\nsale of our ethanol plant located in Jefferson, Wisconsin  (Jefferson ethanol plant).\\n(c)General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 includes a charge of $20 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with a non-\\noperating site.\\n(d)“Other income, net” includes the following:  \\n◦a net gain of $11 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the early retirement of \\n$199 million aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes;  and\\n◦a gain of $26 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022 and a net charge of $24 million in the \\nnine months ended September 30, 2022 related to the early retirement of $1.25 billion and $2.65 billion, \\nrespectively, aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes .\\n(e)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and accompanying earnings release that \\nare not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.\\nWe have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, \\nincluding industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our \\nongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved \\ncomparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating \\nperformance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be \\nconsidered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a \\nsubstitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may \\nnot be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which \\ndiminishes their utility.\\nNon-GAAP measures are as follows:\\n◦Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders  is defined as net income \\nattributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders adjusted to reflect the items noted below, along with their \\nrelated income tax effect. The income tax effect for the adjustments was calculated using a combined federal and \\nstate statutory rate for the U.S.-based adjustments of 22.5 percent and a local statutory income tax rate for foreign-\\nbased adjustments. We have adjusted for these items because we believe that they are not indicative of our core \\noperating performance and that their adjustment results in an important measure of our ongoing financial \\nperformance to better assess our underlying business results and trends. The basis for our belief with respect to \\neach adjustment is provided below.\\n–Modification of RVO  – The net benefit resulting from the modification of our RVO for 2020 and 2021 that \\nwas recognized by us in June 2022 is not associated with the cost of the RVO generated by our operations \\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2022. See note (a) for additional details.\\n–Gain on sale of ethanol plant  – The gain on the sale of our Jefferson ethanol plant (see note (b)) is not \\nindicative of our ongoing operations.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\\nTable Page 18–Environmental reserve adjustment  – The environmental reserve adjustment (see note (c)) is attributable to \\na site that was shut down by prior owners and subsequently acquired by us (referred to by us as a non-\\noperating site).\\n–Loss (gain) on early retirement of debt  – Discounts, premiums, and other expenses recognized in \\nconnection with the early retirement of various series of our senior notes (see note (d)) are not associated \\nwith the ongoing costs of our borrowing and financing activities.\\n◦Adjusted earnings per common share – assuming dilution  is defined as adjusted net income attributable to \\nValero Energy Corporation stockholders divided by the number of weighted-average shares outstanding in the \\napplicable period, assuming dilution.\\n◦Refining margin is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification of RVO adjustment \\n(see note (a)), operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and \\namortization expense, and other operating expenses. We believe Refining margin is an important measure of our \\nRefining segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s \\nmarket reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our \\nperformance.\\n◦Renewable Diesel margin  is defined as Renewable Diesel segment operating income excluding operating \\nexpenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense. We \\nbelieve Renewable Diesel margin is an important measure of our Renewable Diesel segment’s operating and \\nfinancial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, \\nwhich are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Ethanol margin  is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding \\ndepreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. We \\nbelieve Ethanol margin is an important measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance as it \\nis the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry \\nanalysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Adjusted Refining operating income is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification \\nof RVO adjustment (see note (a)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Refining operating income is \\nan important measure of our Refining segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that \\nare not indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted Ethanol operating income is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding the gain on sale \\nof ethanol plant (see note (b)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Ethanol operating income is an \\nimportant measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that are \\nnot indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities \\nexcluding the items noted below. We believe adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is an important \\nmeasure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our ability to generate cash to fund our investing and \\nfinancing activities. The basis for our belief with respect to each excluded item is provided below.\\n–Changes in current assets and current liabilities  – Current assets net of current liabilities represents our \\noperating liquidity. We believe that the change in our operating liquidity from period to period does not \\nrepresent cash generated by our operations that is available to fund our investing and financing activities.\\n–DGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating activities attributable to the other joint venture member’s \\nownership interest in DGD  – We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and we consolidate \\nDGD’s financial statements. Our Renewable Diesel segment includes the operations of DGD and the \\nassociated activities to market its products. Because we consolidate DGD’s financial statements, all of \\nDGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated \\nnet cash provided by operating activities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 19DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current \\nliabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Nevertheless, \\nDGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member and only 50 percent of DGD’s \\noperating cash flow should be attributed to our net cash provided by operating activities. Therefore, we \\nhave adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities for the portion of DGD’s operating cash flow \\nattributable to the other joint venture member’s ownership interest because we believe that it more \\naccurately reflects the operating cash flow available to us to fund our investing and financing activities. \\nThe adjustment is calculated as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,Nine Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,\\n2023 2022 2023 2022\\nDGD operating cash flow data\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (28) $ 512 $ 487 $ 661 \\nExclude: Changes in current assets and current\\nliabilities  (192)  273  (408)  73 \\nAdjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities  164  239  895  588 \\nOther joint venture member’s ownership interest 50% 50% 50% 50%\\nDGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities attributable to the other joint venture\\nmember’s ownership interest in DGD $ 82 $ 119 $ 447 $ 294 \\n◦Capital investments attributable to Valero is defined as all capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and \\ncatalyst cost expenditures presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the portion of DGD’s \\ncapital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of VIEs other \\nthan DGD.\\nDGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to \\nfund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash \\nflow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed \\nto our net share of total capital investments. We also exclude the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we \\nconsolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an \\nimportant measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.\\n(f)The Refining segment regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: U.S. Gulf Coast - Corpus Christi East, \\nCorpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; \\nU.S. Mid Continent - Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; North Atlantic - Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; \\nand U.S. West Coast - Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.\\n(g)Primarily includes petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.\\n(h)Valero uses certain operating statistics (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and the accompanying earnings \\nrelease to evaluate performance between comparable periods. Different companies may calculate them in different ways.\\nAll per barrel of throughput, per gallon of sales, and per gallon of production amounts are calculated by dividing the \\nassociated dollar amount by the throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the period, as applicable.\\nThroughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput volumes per day, \\nsales volumes per day, and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables), respectively, by the \\nnumber of days in the applicable period. We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the \\nRefining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who \\noperate facilities similar to those included in our segments. We believe the use of such volumes results in per unit amounts \\nthat are most representative of the product margins generated and the operating costs incurred as a result of our operation of \\nthose facilities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 20(i)The RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program. The RVO cost is \\ncalculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class \\nof renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the \\nquotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels \\nconsumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding \\ntogether the results of each calculation.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 21\\n```\\n\"\n",

Refin ing throughput volumes averaged \\n3.0 million barrels per day in the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n “Our refineries operated well and achieved 95 percent throughput capacity utilization, which is a \\ntestament to our team’ s relentless focus on operational excellence,” said Lane Riggs , Valero ’s \\nChief Ex ecutive Officer  and President . “Product demand remained strong in our U.S. wholesale \\nsystem, which matched the second quarter record of over 1 million barrels per day of sales volume .” \\n Renewable Diesel  \\nThe Renewable Diesel segment , which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel  joint venture  (DGD) , \\nreported $123 million of operating income for the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to $212 million \\nfor the third  quarter  of 2022. Segment s ales volumes averaged 3.0 million  gallons per day in the \\nthird  quarter  of 2023, which was 761 thousand gallons per day higher  than the third  quarter  of \\n2022. The higher  sales volumes w ere due to the impact of additional volumes from  the DGD Port \\n Arthur plant , which started up in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Operating income was lower than the \\nthird quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower renewable diesel margin in the third quarter of 2023.  \\n \\nEthanol  \\nThe Ethanol segment reported $197 million  of operating income  for the third  quarter  of 2023, \\ncompared to  $1 million for the third  quarter  of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged  \\n4.3 million gallons per day in the third  quarter  of 2023, which was 831 thousand gallons per day \\nhigher  than the third  quarter of 2022. Operating income was higher than the third quarter of 2022 \\nprimarily as a result of higher production volumes and lower corn prices in the third quarter of \\n2023.  \\n \\nCorporate and Other  \\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $250  million in the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to \\n$214 million in the third  quarter  of 2022. The effective tax rate for the third  quarter of 2023 was \\n23 percent . \\n Investing and Financing Activities  \\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion  in the third  quarter  of 2023. Included in \\nthis amount was a $33 million favorable change in  working capital and $82 million  of adjusted net \\ncash provided by operating activities associated with the other  joint venture member ’s share of \\nDGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion  \\nin the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n Capital investments totaled $394 million in the third  quarter  of 2023, of which $303 m illion  was \\nfor sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, cata lysts and regulatory compliance . \\nExcluding capital investments attributable to the other  joint venture member ’s share of DGD, \\ncapital investments attributable to Valero were $35 2 million . \\n \\nValero returned $2.2 billion to stockholders in the third  quarter of 2023, of which $360 million \\nwas paid as dividends and $1.8 billion was for the purchase of approximately 13 million shares of  common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 68 percent of adjusted net cash provided by operating \\nactivities .  \\n \\nValero continues to target an annual  payout ratio between 40 and 50 percent of adjusted net cash \\nprovided by operating activities. Valero defines payout ratio as the sum of dividends  paid and the \\ntotal cost of stock buybacks divided by net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for \\nchanges in working capital and DGD ’s net cash provided by operating activities, excluding \\nchanges in its working capital, attributable to the other joint venture member ’s share of  DGD.  \\n \\nLiquidity and Financial Position  \\nValero ended  the third  quarter of 2023 with $9.2 billion of total debt , $2.3 billion of  finance lease \\nobligations and $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents . The debt to capitalization ratio, net of  \\ncash and cash equivalents, was 17 percent  as of September  30, 2023.  \\n \\nStrategic Update  \\nThe Sustainable Aviation Fuel ( SAF) project at the DGD Port Arthur plant remains on schedule \\nand is expected to be completed in 2025 and cost $315 million, with half of that attributable to \\nValero . The project  is expected to  give the plant  the optionality  to upgrade approximately \\n50 percent of its current 470 million gallon renewable diesel annual production capacity  to SAF . \\nWith the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers \\nof SAF in the world.  \\n “While there ar e broader factors that may drive market  volatility , we remain  focused on things we \\ncan control ,” said Riggs , “including operating efficiently in a safe, reliable and environmentally \\nresponsible manner, maintaining capital discipline by adhering to a minimum return threshold on \\ngrowth projects, and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns .”  \\n \\nConference Call  \\nValero ’s senior management will hold a conference call at 10  a.m.  ET today to discuss this earnings \\nrelease and to provide an update on oper ations and strategy.

As a result of the \\nfinal rule released by the EPA as noted above, we recognized a benefit of $104 million in the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 primarily related to the modification of the 2020 quotas.\\n(b)Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 includes a gain of $23 million on the \\nsale of our ethanol plant located in Jefferson, Wisconsin  (Jefferson ethanol plant).\\n(c)General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 includes a charge of $20 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with a non-\\noperating site.\\n(d)“Other income, net” includes the following:  \\n◦a net gain of $11 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the early retirement of \\n$199 million aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes;  and\\n◦a gain of $26 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022 and a net charge of $24 million in the \\nnine months ended September 30, 2022 related to the early retirement of $1.25 billion and $2.65 billion, \\nrespectively, aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes .\\n(e)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and accompanying earnings release that \\nare not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.\\nWe have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, \\nincluding industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our \\nongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved \\ncomparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating \\nperformance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be \\nconsidered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a \\nsubstitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may \\nnot be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which \\ndiminishes their utility.\\nNon-GAAP measures are as follows:\\n◦Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders  is defined as net income \\nattributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders adjusted to reflect the items noted below, along with their \\nrelated income tax effect. The income tax effect for the adjustments was calculated using a combined federal and \\nstate statutory rate for the U.S.-based adjustments of 22.5 percent and a local statutory income tax rate for foreign-\\nbased adjustments. We have adjusted for these items because we believe that they are not indicative of our core \\noperating performance and that their adjustment results in an important measure of our ongoing financial \\nperformance to better assess our underlying business results and trends. The basis for our belief with respect to \\neach adjustment is provided below.\\n–Modification of RVO  – The net benefit resulting from the modification of our RVO for 2020 and 2021 that \\nwas recognized by us in June 2022 is not associated with the cost of the RVO generated by our operations \\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2022. See note (a) for additional details.\\n–Gain on sale of ethanol plant  – The gain on the sale of our Jefferson ethanol plant (see note (b)) is not \\nindicative of our ongoing operations.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\\nTable Page 18–Environmental reserve adjustment  – The environmental reserve adjustment (see note (c)) is attributable to \\na site that was shut down by prior owners and subsequently acquired by us (referred to by us as a non-\\noperating site).\\n–Loss (gain) on early retirement of debt  – Discounts, premiums, and other expenses recognized in \\nconnection with the early retirement of various series of our senior notes (see note (d)) are not associated \\nwith the ongoing costs of our borrowing and financing activities.\\n◦Adjusted earnings per common share – assuming dilution  is defined as adjusted net income attributable to \\nValero Energy Corporation stockholders divided by the number of weighted-average shares outstanding in the \\napplicable period, assuming dilution.\\n◦Refining margin is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification of RVO adjustment \\n(see note (a)), operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and \\namortization expense, and other operating expenses. We believe Refining margin is an important measure of our \\nRefining segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s \\nmarket reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our \\nperformance.\\n◦Renewable Diesel margin  is defined as Renewable Diesel segment operating income excluding operating \\nexpenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense. We \\nbelieve Renewable Diesel margin is an important measure of our Renewable Diesel segment’s operating and \\nfinancial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, \\nwhich are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Ethanol margin  is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding \\ndepreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. We \\nbelieve Ethanol margin is an important measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance as it \\nis the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry \\nanalysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Adjusted Refining operating income is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification \\nof RVO adjustment (see note (a)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Refining operating income is \\nan important measure of our Refining segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that \\nare not indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted Ethanol operating income is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding the gain on sale \\nof ethanol plant (see note (b)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Ethanol operating income is an \\nimportant measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that are \\nnot indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities \\nexcluding the items noted below. We believe adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is an important \\nmeasure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our ability to generate cash to fund our investing and \\nfinancing activities. The basis for our belief with respect to each excluded item is provided below.\\n–Changes in current assets and current liabilities  – Current assets net of current liabilities represents our \\noperating liquidity. We believe that the change in our operating liquidity from period to period does not \\nrepresent cash generated by our operations that is available to fund our investing and financing activities.\\n–DGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating activities attributable to the other joint venture member’s \\nownership interest in DGD  – We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and we consolidate \\nDGD’s financial statements. Our Renewable Diesel segment includes the operations of DGD and the \\nassociated activities to market its products. Because we consolidate DGD’s financial statements, all of \\nDGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated \\nnet cash provided by operating activities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 19DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current \\nliabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Nevertheless, \\nDGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member and only 50 percent of DGD’s \\noperating cash flow should be attributed to our net cash provided by operating activities. Therefore, we \\nhave adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities for the portion of DGD’s operating cash flow \\nattributable to the other joint venture member’s ownership interest because we believe that it more \\naccurately reflects the operating cash flow available to us to fund our investing and financing activities. \\nThe adjustment is calculated as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,Nine Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,\\n2023 2022 2023 2022\\nDGD operating cash flow data\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (28) $ 512 $ 487 $ 661 \\nExclude: Changes in current assets and current\\nliabilities  (192)  273  (408)  73 \\nAdjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities  164  239  895  588 \\nOther joint venture member’s ownership interest 50% 50% 50% 50%\\nDGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities attributable to the other joint venture\\nmember’s ownership interest in DGD $ 82 $ 119 $ 447 $ 294 \\n◦Capital investments attributable to Valero is defined as all capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and \\ncatalyst cost expenditures presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the portion of DGD’s \\ncapital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of VIEs other \\nthan DGD.\\nDGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to \\nfund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash \\nflow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed \\nto our net share of total capital investments. We also exclude the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we \\nconsolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an \\nimportant measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.\\n(f)The Refining segment regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: U.S. Gulf Coast - Corpus Christi East, \\nCorpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; \\nU.S. Mid Continent - Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; North Atlantic - Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; \\nand U.S. West Coast - Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.\\n(g)Primarily includes petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.\\n(h)Valero uses certain operating statistics (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and the accompanying earnings \\nrelease to evaluate performance between comparable periods. Different companies may calculate them in different ways.\\nAll per barrel of throughput, per gallon of sales, and per gallon of production amounts are calculated by dividing the \\nassociated dollar amount by the throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the period, as applicable.\\nThroughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput volumes per day, \\nsales volumes per day, and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables), respectively, by the \\nnumber of days in the applicable period. We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the \\nRefining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who \\noperate facilities similar to those included in our segments. We believe the use of such volumes results in per unit amounts \\nthat are most representative of the product margins generated and the operating costs incurred as a result of our operation of \\nthose facilities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 20(i)The RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program. The RVO cost is \\ncalculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class \\nof renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the \\nquotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels \\nconsumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding \\ntogether the results of each calculation.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 21\\n```\\n\"\n",

As part of AWS’s long-term commitment, it is planning to invest more than $5.3 billion in the \\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and more than $5 billion in Mexico over the next several years. •A planned investment of $10 billion to build two data center complexes in Mississippi. This investment, \\nwhich is the single largest capital investment in the state’s history, will create at least 1,000 jobs and support \\nnew educational trainings in the state.\\n•The general availability of new AWS Local Zones in Atlanta, Chicago, and Houston. In Atlanta, AWS Local \\nZones support EC2 P5 instances, which deliver the highest performance for deep learning and high-\\nperformance computing applications.\\n•Announced that AWS began waiving charges for data transfer out to the internet (DTO) to give customers choice if \\nthey want to migrate their data outside of AWS. The waiver on DTO charges is available to all AWS customers around \\nthe world and from any AWS Region. \\nInventing on behalf of customers \\nAmazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that \\ncustomers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better \\nin some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:\\n•Announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for accelerating \\nsoftware development and leveraging companies’ internal data.\\n•On the software development side, Amazon Q not only generates highly accurate code, but also tests code, \\ndebugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another (today, developers can save months \\nusing Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones; in the near future, Q \\nwill help developers transform their .net code as well). Q Developer Agents does multi-step planning and \\nreasoning to allow developers to string together multiple requests and have Q implement them.\\n•On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of data that reside in wikis, intranet pages, \\nSalesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3, and many other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to \\naccess. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, \\ncode, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. Customers can point Q \\nat all of its enterprise data repositories, and it’ll search this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and \\nengage in dialog with customers about this data. With the launch of a powerful new capability called Q Apps, \\nemployees can now describe, in natural language, what apps they want to build on top of this internal data, \\nand Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This will make it much easier for internal teams to build useful \\napps from their own data.\\n•Delivered a number of innovations in Amazon Bedrock (AWS’s generative AI service that enables customers to \\nleverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features \\navailable to deploy secure, high quality, low latency, cost-effective production generative AI apps).

Claude 3 Opus has set a new standard, outperforming other \\nmodels available today in the areas of reasoning, math, and coding. Amazon Bedrock became the first \\nmanaged service to add Claude 3 models, and continues to provide customers with the widest choice of high-\\nperforming, fully-managed large language models (LLMs) and FMs.\\n•The general availability of Meta Llama 3 models, a collection of pretrained and instruction fine-tuned LLMs \\nthat come in two sizes—8B and 70B. The new models demonstrate significant improvements over previous \\nversions due to vastly increased training data and scale. This collection of models supports a broad range of \\nuse cases, like text summarization and classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and code \\ngeneration.\\n•The addition of FMs from leading AI startup Mistral AI. Mistral Large, the latest and most advanced LLM \\nfrom Mistral AI, provides top-tier reasoning capabilities for complex multilingual reasoning tasks. Mistral \\nAI’s Mixtral 8x7B and Mistral 7B models can summarize, answer questions, and help organize information \\nwith their deep understanding of text structure and architecture. \\n•The availability of new Cohere models (Command R and Command R+) on Bedrock.\\n•New first party Amazon Titan LLMs, including Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 and the general \\navailability of Amazon Titan Image Generator.•The general availability of Model Evaluation, which is the fastest way for organizations to analyze, compare, \\nand select models on Amazon Bedrock, reducing time from weeks to hours spent evaluating models so \\ncustomers can bring new applications and experiences to market faster.\\n•The general availability of Guardrails, which provides customers with best-in-class technology to easily \\nimplement safeguards to remove personal and sensitive information, profanity, specific words, and harmful \\ncontent. Guardrails offers industry-leading safety protection on top of the native capabilities of FMs, helping \\ncustomers block up to 85% of harmful content. Guardrails is the only solution offered by a broad cloud \\nprovider that allows customers to have built-in and custom safeguards in a single offering, and it works with \\nall LLMs in Amazon Bedrock, as well as fine-tuned models. \\n•The new Custom Model Import capability that makes it simple for customers to import models from \\nSageMaker (or elsewhere) into Bedrock before deploying their application—enabling customers to take \\nadvantage of all the Bedrock features that make it so much easier to build high quality production-grade \\ngenerative AI apps.\\n•Announced the extension of AWS and NVIDIA’s strategic collaboration to make AWS the best place to run NVIDIA \\nGPUs, helping customers unlock new generative AI capabilities. AWS will bring together NVIDIA’s next-generation \\nBlackwell platform with AWS Nitro System and AWS Key Management Service advanced security, Elastic Fabric \\nAdapter petabit-scale networking, and Amazon EC2 UltraCluster hyper-scale clustering, enabling customers to \\nsecurely build and run multi-trillion parameter LLMs faster, at massive scale, and at a lower cost than previous-\\ngeneration NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2. In addition, Project Ceiba, an AI supercomputer being jointly developed \\nby AWS and NVIDIA exclusively on AWS for NVIDIA’s own AI research and development, will be built on the \\nBlackwell platform.\\n•Continued to meet growing demand for AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, which help customers maximize \\nperformance and control costs for their machine learning (ML) workloads. Customers using these purpose-built AWS \\nML AI chips include Anthropic, Databricks, Leonardo.ai, Qualtrics, Ricoh, Stockmark, Watashiha, and Vyond. In \\naddition, Meta's recently-launched Llama 3 model is running on Trainium and Inferentia2—delivering the lowest cost \\nto train, fine tune, and deploy Llama 3 on AWS.\\n•Updated AWS Neuron (software that lets customers use popular frameworks like PyTorch to train and deploy models \\nwith minimal code changes on Amazon EC2 instances, powered by Trainium and Inferentia chips) to include features \\nthat further reduce costs for LLM inference for both external customers and internal teams at Amazon, such as \\nAmazon Rufus.\\n•Continued to rollout Rufus in the Amazon Shopping app to millions of customers in the U.S. Rufus, in beta, is a new \\ngenerative AI-powered shopping assistant that can help customers save time and make more informed purchase \\ndecisions by answering a variety of shopping-related questions, providing product comparisons, making \\nrecommendations, and more. Amazon improved Rufus’ answer accuracy and response speed, and added new features, \\nincluding “My Orders,” which answers questions such as “when did I last order coffee?” and “what dog treats did I last \\norder?”\\n•Added more generative AI features for independent sellers in the U.S. to create product listings, including a new tool \\nthat allows sellers to leverage product listings on their own websites, simply by providing Amazon with a URL. \\nAmazon’s generative AI-based features automatically parse the information to seamlessly create high-quality, \\nengaging listings for Amazon’s store. This feature further enhances and streamlines the process of creating product \\nlistings, saving sellers time and effort, while also developing product listings that appeal to customers and help drive \\nsales.\\n•Released 20 films and series from Amazon MGM Studios, including the debut season of Fallout , which attracted more \\nthan 65 million viewers worldwide and has become the second most watched title ever on Prime Video through its first \\n16 days; Road House , which attracted more than 50 million viewers worldwide in its first two weekends streaming on \\nPrime Video, the biggest debut ever for an Amazon MGM Studios-produced film;  Hazbin Hotel , which had the most \\ntotal global viewers on its opening weekend for a new animated series on Prime Video; and The Beekeeper , which \\nranked in the top-10 of theatrical releases by revenue globally in the first quarter.\\n•Announced plans to create a new series from MrBeast, the world’s most-subscribed YouTube creator.

Refin ing throughput volumes averaged \\n3.0 million barrels per day in the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n “Our refineries operated well and achieved 95 percent throughput capacity utilization, which is a \\ntestament to our team’ s relentless focus on operational excellence,” said Lane Riggs , Valero ’s \\nChief Ex ecutive Officer  and President . “Product demand remained strong in our U.S. wholesale \\nsystem, which matched the second quarter record of over 1 million barrels per day of sales volume .” \\n Renewable Diesel  \\nThe Renewable Diesel segment , which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel  joint venture  (DGD) , \\nreported $123 million of operating income for the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to $212 million \\nfor the third  quarter  of 2022. Segment s ales volumes averaged 3.0 million  gallons per day in the \\nthird  quarter  of 2023, which was 761 thousand gallons per day higher  than the third  quarter  of \\n2022. The higher  sales volumes w ere due to the impact of additional volumes from  the DGD Port \\n Arthur plant , which started up in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Operating income was lower than the \\nthird quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower renewable diesel margin in the third quarter of 2023.  \\n \\nEthanol  \\nThe Ethanol segment reported $197 million  of operating income  for the third  quarter  of 2023, \\ncompared to  $1 million for the third  quarter  of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged  \\n4.3 million gallons per day in the third  quarter  of 2023, which was 831 thousand gallons per day \\nhigher  than the third  quarter of 2022. Operating income was higher than the third quarter of 2022 \\nprimarily as a result of higher production volumes and lower corn prices in the third quarter of \\n2023.  \\n \\nCorporate and Other  \\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $250  million in the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to \\n$214 million in the third  quarter  of 2022. The effective tax rate for the third  quarter of 2023 was \\n23 percent . \\n Investing and Financing Activities  \\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion  in the third  quarter  of 2023. Included in \\nthis amount was a $33 million favorable change in  working capital and $82 million  of adjusted net \\ncash provided by operating activities associated with the other  joint venture member ’s share of \\nDGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion  \\nin the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n Capital investments totaled $394 million in the third  quarter  of 2023, of which $303 m illion  was \\nfor sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, cata lysts and regulatory compliance . \\nExcluding capital investments attributable to the other  joint venture member ’s share of DGD, \\ncapital investments attributable to Valero were $35 2 million . \\n \\nValero returned $2.2 billion to stockholders in the third  quarter of 2023, of which $360 million \\nwas paid as dividends and $1.8 billion was for the purchase of approximately 13 million shares of  common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 68 percent of adjusted net cash provided by operating \\nactivities .  \\n \\nValero continues to target an annual  payout ratio between 40 and 50 percent of adjusted net cash \\nprovided by operating activities. Valero defines payout ratio as the sum of dividends  paid and the \\ntotal cost of stock buybacks divided by net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for \\nchanges in working capital and DGD ’s net cash provided by operating activities, excluding \\nchanges in its working capital, attributable to the other joint venture member ’s share of  DGD.  \\n \\nLiquidity and Financial Position  \\nValero ended  the third  quarter of 2023 with $9.2 billion of total debt , $2.3 billion of  finance lease \\nobligations and $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents . The debt to capitalization ratio, net of  \\ncash and cash equivalents, was 17 percent  as of September  30, 2023.  \\n \\nStrategic Update  \\nThe Sustainable Aviation Fuel ( SAF) project at the DGD Port Arthur plant remains on schedule \\nand is expected to be completed in 2025 and cost $315 million, with half of that attributable to \\nValero . The project  is expected to  give the plant  the optionality  to upgrade approximately \\n50 percent of its current 470 million gallon renewable diesel annual production capacity  to SAF . \\nWith the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers \\nof SAF in the world.  \\n “While there ar e broader factors that may drive market  volatility , we remain  focused on things we \\ncan control ,” said Riggs , “including operating efficiently in a safe, reliable and environmentally \\nresponsible manner, maintaining capital discipline by adhering to a minimum return threshold on \\ngrowth projects, and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns .”  \\n \\nConference Call  \\nValero ’s senior management will hold a conference call at 10  a.m.  ET today to discuss this earnings \\nrelease and to provide an update on oper ations and strategy.

FINANCIAL DATA\\n(millions of dollars, except per share amounts)\\n(unaudited)\\nTable Page 17(a)Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) is required to set \\nannual quotas for the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties, such as us, must blend into petroleum-based \\ntransportation fuels consumed in the U.S. The quotas are used to determine an obligated party’s RVO. The EPA released a \\nfinal rule on June  3, 2022 that, among other things, modified the volume standards for 2020 and, for the first time, \\nestablished volume standards for 2021 and 2022.\\nIn 2020, we recognized the cost of the RVO using the 2020 quotas set by the EPA at that time, and in 2021 and the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized the cost of the RVO using our estimates of the quotas. As a result of the \\nfinal rule released by the EPA as noted above, we recognized a benefit of $104 million in the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 primarily related to the modification of the 2020 quotas.\\n(b)Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 includes a gain of $23 million on the \\nsale of our ethanol plant located in Jefferson, Wisconsin  (Jefferson ethanol plant).\\n(c)General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 includes a charge of $20 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with a non-\\noperating site.\\n(d)“Other income, net” includes the following:  \\n◦a net gain of $11 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the early retirement of \\n$199 million aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes;  and\\n◦a gain of $26 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022 and a net charge of $24 million in the \\nnine months ended September 30, 2022 related to the early retirement of $1.25 billion and $2.65 billion, \\nrespectively, aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes .\\n(e)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and accompanying earnings release that \\nare not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.\\nWe have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, \\nincluding industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our \\nongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved \\ncomparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating \\nperformance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be \\nconsidered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a \\nsubstitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may \\nnot be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which \\ndiminishes their utility.\\nNon-GAAP measures are as follows:\\n◦Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders  is defined as net income \\nattributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders adjusted to reflect the items noted below, along with their \\nrelated income tax effect. The income tax effect for the adjustments was calculated using a combined federal and \\nstate statutory rate for the U.S.-based adjustments of 22.5 percent and a local statutory income tax rate for foreign-\\nbased adjustments. We have adjusted for these items because we believe that they are not indicative of our core \\noperating performance and that their adjustment results in an important measure of our ongoing financial \\nperformance to better assess our underlying business results and trends. The basis for our belief with respect to \\neach adjustment is provided below.\\n–Modification of RVO  – The net benefit resulting from the modification of our RVO for 2020 and 2021 that \\nwas recognized by us in June 2022 is not associated with the cost of the RVO generated by our operations \\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2022. See note (a) for additional details.\\n–Gain on sale of ethanol plant  – The gain on the sale of our Jefferson ethanol plant (see note (b)) is not \\nindicative of our ongoing operations.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\\nTable Page 18–Environmental reserve adjustment  – The environmental reserve adjustment (see note (c)) is attributable to \\na site that was shut down by prior owners and subsequently acquired by us (referred to by us as a non-\\noperating site).\\n–Loss (gain) on early retirement of debt  – Discounts, premiums, and other expenses recognized in \\nconnection with the early retirement of various series of our senior notes (see note (d)) are not associated \\nwith the ongoing costs of our borrowing and financing activities.\\n◦Adjusted earnings per common share – assuming dilution  is defined as adjusted net income attributable to \\nValero Energy Corporation stockholders divided by the number of weighted-average shares outstanding in the \\napplicable period, assuming dilution.\\n◦Refining margin is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification of RVO adjustment \\n(see note (a)), operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and \\namortization expense, and other operating expenses. We believe Refining margin is an important measure of our \\nRefining segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s \\nmarket reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our \\nperformance.\\n◦Renewable Diesel margin  is defined as Renewable Diesel segment operating income excluding operating \\nexpenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense. We \\nbelieve Renewable Diesel margin is an important measure of our Renewable Diesel segment’s operating and \\nfinancial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, \\nwhich are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Ethanol margin  is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding \\ndepreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. We \\nbelieve Ethanol margin is an important measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance as it \\nis the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry \\nanalysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Adjusted Refining operating income is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification \\nof RVO adjustment (see note (a)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Refining operating income is \\nan important measure of our Refining segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that \\nare not indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted Ethanol operating income is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding the gain on sale \\nof ethanol plant (see note (b)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Ethanol operating income is an \\nimportant measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that are \\nnot indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities \\nexcluding the items noted below. We believe adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is an important \\nmeasure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our ability to generate cash to fund our investing and \\nfinancing activities. The basis for our belief with respect to each excluded item is provided below.\\n–Changes in current assets and current liabilities  – Current assets net of current liabilities represents our \\noperating liquidity. We believe that the change in our operating liquidity from period to period does not \\nrepresent cash generated by our operations that is available to fund our investing and financing activities.\\n–DGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating activities attributable to the other joint venture member’s \\nownership interest in DGD  – We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and we consolidate \\nDGD’s financial statements. Our Renewable Diesel segment includes the operations of DGD and the \\nassociated activities to market its products. Because we consolidate DGD’s financial statements, all of \\nDGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated \\nnet cash provided by operating activities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 19DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current \\nliabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Nevertheless, \\nDGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member and only 50 percent of DGD’s \\noperating cash flow should be attributed to our net cash provided by operating activities. Therefore, we \\nhave adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities for the portion of DGD’s operating cash flow \\nattributable to the other joint venture member’s ownership interest because we believe that it more \\naccurately reflects the operating cash flow available to us to fund our investing and financing activities. \\nThe adjustment is calculated as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,Nine Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,\\n2023 2022 2023 2022\\nDGD operating cash flow data\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (28) $ 512 $ 487 $ 661 \\nExclude: Changes in current assets and current\\nliabilities  (192)  273  (408)  73 \\nAdjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities  164  239  895  588 \\nOther joint venture member’s ownership interest 50% 50% 50% 50%\\nDGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities attributable to the other joint venture\\nmember’s ownership interest in DGD $ 82 $ 119 $ 447 $ 294 \\n◦Capital investments attributable to Valero is defined as all capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and \\ncatalyst cost expenditures presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the portion of DGD’s \\ncapital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of VIEs other \\nthan DGD.\\nDGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to \\nfund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash \\nflow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed \\nto our net share of total capital investments. We also exclude the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we \\nconsolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an \\nimportant measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.\\n(f)The Refining segment regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: U.S. Gulf Coast - Corpus Christi East, \\nCorpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; \\nU.S. Mid Continent - Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; North Atlantic - Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; \\nand U.S. West Coast - Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.\\n(g)Primarily includes petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.\\n(h)Valero uses certain operating statistics (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and the accompanying earnings \\nrelease to evaluate performance between comparable periods. Different companies may calculate them in different ways.\\nAll per barrel of throughput, per gallon of sales, and per gallon of production amounts are calculated by dividing the \\nassociated dollar amount by the throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the period, as applicable.\\nThroughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput volumes per day, \\nsales volumes per day, and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables), respectively, by the \\nnumber of days in the applicable period. We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the \\nRefining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who \\noperate facilities similar to those included in our segments. We believe the use of such volumes results in per unit amounts \\nthat are most representative of the product margins generated and the operating costs incurred as a result of our operation of \\nthose facilities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 20(i)The RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program. The RVO cost is \\ncalculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class \\nof renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the \\nquotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels \\nconsumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding \\ntogether the results of each calculation.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 21\\n```\\n\"\n",

This collaboration will help organizations like the District \\nof Columbia Department of Health speed innovation, improve customer service, and improve productivity, \\nwhile keeping data private and secure. \\n•BT Group, a multinational communications company, provided Amazon Q Developer to 1,200 of its \\nengineers, generating more than 100,000 lines of code in its first four months and automating approximately \\n12% of the repetitive and time-consuming work done by software engineers using the platform.\\n•The Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) named AWS the Official Generative AI Provider of the DFL, and is using \\nAI on AWS to generate metadata that allows the league, clubs, and media partners to more efficiently search \\nfor content in more than 210,000 hours of video footage.\\n•Audi used Amazon SageMaker and Amazon OpenSearch Service to build a generative AI chatbot to improve \\nits enterprise search experience and help employees find and navigate internal documentation, reducing \\nsearch time from hours to a few seconds and improving productivity. \\n•Konica Minolta Healthcare, a medical diagnostic imaging and healthcare information technology company, \\nannounced an enterprise imaging cloud platform using AWS HealthImaging to reduce image storage costs, \\nenable access from almost anywhere, and accelerate data retrieval. \\n•Dana-Farber Cancer Institute built a new research solution on Amazon Bedrock to help clinicians interpret \\ncomplex lab results to help diagnose medical conditions, assess treatment efficacy, and determine next steps \\nin clinical care.\\n•Enterprise healthcare software provider symplr announced a generative AI solution that uses Amazon \\nBedrock and Amazon Q to connect and optimize hospital operations so clinicians and administrators can \\nquickly access relevant data, simplifying staff scheduling and other administrative processes.\\n•Choice Hotels became the first hotel company to migrate its entire system infrastructure to the cloud. The \\nmove to AWS is part of Choice Hotels’ long-term technology roadmap and adoption of AI, and involves \\ndecommissioning more than 3,700 servers, retiring over 300 applications, and migrating more than 250 \\napplications. \\n•Mobile network operator Tele2 launched an Internet of Things customer support solution, powered by \\nAmazon Bedrock, to help agents provide faster and more detailed conversational responses to customers \\nacross multiple channels. \\n•Vonage, a cloud communications provider, announced a new anti-fraud solution with AWS generative AI \\ncapabilities to enable businesses to better protect themselves from mobile fraud while improving customer \\nexperiences.\\n•Genomics England, a human genome research organization, is using Amazon Bedrock to help researchers \\nidentify associations between genetic variants and medical conditions by quickly processing millions of pages \\nof scientific literature, with the goal of informing future genetic tests and improving human health. \\n•AI biotechnology company Owkin selected AWS as its primary cloud provider to develop generative AI \\napplications and accelerate drug discovery and development, empowering scientists and researchers to access, \\nanalyze, and manage vast amounts of data efficiently and securely in the cloud.\\n•Parsyl, a data-powered insurer, is using Amazon Bedrock to turn unwieldy customer information, like email \\nattachments in different formats, into usable data to help identify patterns of risk for businesses transporting \\ngoods. \\n•Continued to expand AWS’s infrastructure footprint to support customers by announcing:\\n•Plans to launch new infrastructure Regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in Mexico, which will give \\ndevelopers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises greater choice for running their applications and serving \\nend users. As part of AWS’s long-term commitment, it is planning to invest more than $5.3 billion in the \\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and more than $5 billion in Mexico over the next several years. •A planned investment of $10 billion to build two data center complexes in Mississippi. This investment, \\nwhich is the single largest capital investment in the state’s history, will create at least 1,000 jobs and support \\nnew educational trainings in the state.\\n•The general availability of new AWS Local Zones in Atlanta, Chicago, and Houston. In Atlanta, AWS Local \\nZones support EC2 P5 instances, which deliver the highest performance for deep learning and high-\\nperformance computing applications.\\n•Announced that AWS began waiving charges for data transfer out to the internet (DTO) to give customers choice if \\nthey want to migrate their data outside of AWS. The waiver on DTO charges is available to all AWS customers around \\nthe world and from any AWS Region. \\nInventing on behalf of customers \\nAmazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that \\ncustomers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better \\nin some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:\\n•Announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for accelerating \\nsoftware development and leveraging companies’ internal data.\\n•On the software development side, Amazon Q not only generates highly accurate code, but also tests code, \\ndebugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another (today, developers can save months \\nusing Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones; in the near future, Q \\nwill help developers transform their .net code as well). Q Developer Agents does multi-step planning and \\nreasoning to allow developers to string together multiple requests and have Q implement them.\\n•On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of data that reside in wikis, intranet pages, \\nSalesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3, and many other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to \\naccess. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, \\ncode, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. Customers can point Q \\nat all of its enterprise data repositories, and it’ll search this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and \\nengage in dialog with customers about this data. With the launch of a powerful new capability called Q Apps, \\nemployees can now describe, in natural language, what apps they want to build on top of this internal data, \\nand Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This will make it much easier for internal teams to build useful \\napps from their own data.\\n•Delivered a number of innovations in Amazon Bedrock (AWS’s generative AI service that enables customers to \\nleverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features \\navailable to deploy secure, high quality, low latency, cost-effective production generative AI apps). Tens of thousands \\nof organizations worldwide are using Amazon Bedrock. These new Bedrock capabilities include:\\n•The general availability of Anthropic’s Claude 3 family of vision-enabled foundation models (FMs)—Opus, \\nSonnet, and Haiku—which are the best performing models in the world right now and provide industry-\\nleading accuracy, performance, speed, and cost. Claude 3 Opus has set a new standard, outperforming other \\nmodels available today in the areas of reasoning, math, and coding. Amazon Bedrock became the first \\nmanaged service to add Claude 3 models, and continues to provide customers with the widest choice of high-\\nperforming, fully-managed large language models (LLMs) and FMs.\\n•The general availability of Meta Llama 3 models, a collection of pretrained and instruction fine-tuned LLMs \\nthat come in two sizes—8B and 70B.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as \\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and \\nspending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, \\nthe rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies,  and the various factors \\ndetailed below. \\nSecond Quarter 2024  Guidance\\n•Net sales are expected to be between $144.0 billion and $149.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared \\nwith second quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from \\nforeign exchange rates.  In first quarter 2024 the impact from Leap Year added approximately 120 basis points to the \\nyear-over-year net sales growth rate.\\n•Operating income is expected to be between $10.0 billion and $14.0 billion, compared with $7.7 billion in second \\nquarter 2023.  \\n•This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal \\nsettlements are concluded.\\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at \\namazon.com/ir.

Refin ing throughput volumes averaged \\n3.0 million barrels per day in the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n “Our refineries operated well and achieved 95 percent throughput capacity utilization, which is a \\ntestament to our team’ s relentless focus on operational excellence,” said Lane Riggs , Valero ’s \\nChief Ex ecutive Officer  and President . “Product demand remained strong in our U.S. wholesale \\nsystem, which matched the second quarter record of over 1 million barrels per day of sales volume .” \\n Renewable Diesel  \\nThe Renewable Diesel segment , which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel  joint venture  (DGD) , \\nreported $123 million of operating income for the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to $212 million \\nfor the third  quarter  of 2022. Segment s ales volumes averaged 3.0 million  gallons per day in the \\nthird  quarter  of 2023, which was 761 thousand gallons per day higher  than the third  quarter  of \\n2022. The higher  sales volumes w ere due to the impact of additional volumes from  the DGD Port \\n Arthur plant , which started up in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Operating income was lower than the \\nthird quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower renewable diesel margin in the third quarter of 2023.  \\n \\nEthanol  \\nThe Ethanol segment reported $197 million  of operating income  for the third  quarter  of 2023, \\ncompared to  $1 million for the third  quarter  of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged  \\n4.3 million gallons per day in the third  quarter  of 2023, which was 831 thousand gallons per day \\nhigher  than the third  quarter of 2022. Operating income was higher than the third quarter of 2022 \\nprimarily as a result of higher production volumes and lower corn prices in the third quarter of \\n2023.  \\n \\nCorporate and Other  \\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $250  million in the third  quarter  of 2023, compared to \\n$214 million in the third  quarter  of 2022. The effective tax rate for the third  quarter of 2023 was \\n23 percent . \\n Investing and Financing Activities  \\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion  in the third  quarter  of 2023. Included in \\nthis amount was a $33 million favorable change in  working capital and $82 million  of adjusted net \\ncash provided by operating activities associated with the other  joint venture member ’s share of \\nDGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion  \\nin the third  quarter  of 2023. \\n Capital investments totaled $394 million in the third  quarter  of 2023, of which $303 m illion  was \\nfor sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, cata lysts and regulatory compliance . \\nExcluding capital investments attributable to the other  joint venture member ’s share of DGD, \\ncapital investments attributable to Valero were $35 2 million . \\n \\nValero returned $2.2 billion to stockholders in the third  quarter of 2023, of which $360 million \\nwas paid as dividends and $1.8 billion was for the purchase of approximately 13 million shares of  common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 68 percent of adjusted net cash provided by operating \\nactivities .  \\n \\nValero continues to target an annual  payout ratio between 40 and 50 percent of adjusted net cash \\nprovided by operating activities. Valero defines payout ratio as the sum of dividends  paid and the \\ntotal cost of stock buybacks divided by net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for \\nchanges in working capital and DGD ’s net cash provided by operating activities, excluding \\nchanges in its working capital, attributable to the other joint venture member ’s share of  DGD.  \\n \\nLiquidity and Financial Position  \\nValero ended  the third  quarter of 2023 with $9.2 billion of total debt , $2.3 billion of  finance lease \\nobligations and $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents . The debt to capitalization ratio, net of  \\ncash and cash equivalents, was 17 percent  as of September  30, 2023.  \\n \\nStrategic Update  \\nThe Sustainable Aviation Fuel ( SAF) project at the DGD Port Arthur plant remains on schedule \\nand is expected to be completed in 2025 and cost $315 million, with half of that attributable to \\nValero . The project  is expected to  give the plant  the optionality  to upgrade approximately \\n50 percent of its current 470 million gallon renewable diesel annual production capacity  to SAF . \\nWith the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers \\nof SAF in the world.  \\n “While there ar e broader factors that may drive market  volatility , we remain  focused on things we \\ncan control ,” said Riggs , “including operating efficiently in a safe, reliable and environmentally \\nresponsible manner, maintaining capital discipline by adhering to a minimum return threshold on \\ngrowth projects, and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns .”  \\n \\nConference Call  \\nValero ’s senior management will hold a conference call at 10  a.m.  ET today to discuss this earnings \\nrelease and to provide an update on oper ations and strategy.

required to set \\nannual quotas for the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties, such as us, must blend into petroleum-based \\ntransportation fuels consumed in the U.S. The quotas are used to determine an obligated party’s RVO. The EPA released a \\nfinal rule on June  3, 2022 that, among other things, modified the volume standards for 2020 and, for the first time, \\nestablished volume standards for 2021 and 2022.\\nIn 2020, we recognized the cost of the RVO using the 2020 quotas set by the EPA at that time, and in 2021 and the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized the cost of the RVO using our estimates of the quotas. As a result of the \\nfinal rule released by the EPA as noted above, we recognized a benefit of $104 million in the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 primarily related to the modification of the 2020 quotas.\\n(b)Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 includes a gain of $23 million on the \\nsale of our ethanol plant located in Jefferson, Wisconsin  (Jefferson ethanol plant).\\n(c)General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2022 includes a charge of $20 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with a non-\\noperating site.\\n(d)“Other income, net” includes the following:  \\n◦a net gain of $11 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the early retirement of \\n$199 million aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes;  and\\n◦a gain of $26 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022 and a net charge of $24 million in the \\nnine months ended September 30, 2022 related to the early retirement of $1.25 billion and $2.65 billion, \\nrespectively, aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes .\\n(e)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and accompanying earnings release that \\nare not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.\\nWe have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, \\nincluding industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our \\nongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved \\ncomparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating \\nperformance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be \\nconsidered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a \\nsubstitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may \\nnot be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which \\ndiminishes their utility.\\nNon-GAAP measures are as follows:\\n◦Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders  is defined as net income \\nattributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders adjusted to reflect the items noted below, along with their \\nrelated income tax effect. The income tax effect for the adjustments was calculated using a combined federal and \\nstate statutory rate for the U.S.-based adjustments of 22.5 percent and a local statutory income tax rate for foreign-\\nbased adjustments. We have adjusted for these items because we believe that they are not indicative of our core \\noperating performance and that their adjustment results in an important measure of our ongoing financial \\nperformance to better assess our underlying business results and trends. The basis for our belief with respect to \\neach adjustment is provided below.\\n–Modification of RVO  – The net benefit resulting from the modification of our RVO for 2020 and 2021 that \\nwas recognized by us in June 2022 is not associated with the cost of the RVO generated by our operations \\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2022. See note (a) for additional details.\\n–Gain on sale of ethanol plant  – The gain on the sale of our Jefferson ethanol plant (see note (b)) is not \\nindicative of our ongoing operations.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\\nTable Page 18–Environmental reserve adjustment  – The environmental reserve adjustment (see note (c)) is attributable to \\na site that was shut down by prior owners and subsequently acquired by us (referred to by us as a non-\\noperating site).\\n–Loss (gain) on early retirement of debt  – Discounts, premiums, and other expenses recognized in \\nconnection with the early retirement of various series of our senior notes (see note (d)) are not associated \\nwith the ongoing costs of our borrowing and financing activities.\\n◦Adjusted earnings per common share – assuming dilution  is defined as adjusted net income attributable to \\nValero Energy Corporation stockholders divided by the number of weighted-average shares outstanding in the \\napplicable period, assuming dilution.\\n◦Refining margin is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification of RVO adjustment \\n(see note (a)), operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and \\namortization expense, and other operating expenses. We believe Refining margin is an important measure of our \\nRefining segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s \\nmarket reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our \\nperformance.\\n◦Renewable Diesel margin  is defined as Renewable Diesel segment operating income excluding operating \\nexpenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense. We \\nbelieve Renewable Diesel margin is an important measure of our Renewable Diesel segment’s operating and \\nfinancial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, \\nwhich are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Ethanol margin  is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding \\ndepreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. We \\nbelieve Ethanol margin is an important measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance as it \\nis the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry \\nanalysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.\\n◦Adjusted Refining operating income is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification \\nof RVO adjustment (see note (a)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Refining operating income is \\nan important measure of our Refining segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that \\nare not indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted Ethanol operating income is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding the gain on sale \\nof ethanol plant (see note (b)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Ethanol operating income is an \\nimportant measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that are \\nnot indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\\n◦Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities \\nexcluding the items noted below. We believe adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is an important \\nmeasure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our ability to generate cash to fund our investing and \\nfinancing activities. The basis for our belief with respect to each excluded item is provided below.\\n–Changes in current assets and current liabilities  – Current assets net of current liabilities represents our \\noperating liquidity. We believe that the change in our operating liquidity from period to period does not \\nrepresent cash generated by our operations that is available to fund our investing and financing activities.\\n–DGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating activities attributable to the other joint venture member’s \\nownership interest in DGD  – We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and we consolidate \\nDGD’s financial statements. Our Renewable Diesel segment includes the operations of DGD and the \\nassociated activities to market its products. Because we consolidate DGD’s financial statements, all of \\nDGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated \\nnet cash provided by operating activities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 19DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current \\nliabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Nevertheless, \\nDGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member and only 50 percent of DGD’s \\noperating cash flow should be attributed to our net cash provided by operating activities. Therefore, we \\nhave adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities for the portion of DGD’s operating cash flow \\nattributable to the other joint venture member’s ownership interest because we believe that it more \\naccurately reflects the operating cash flow available to us to fund our investing and financing activities. \\nThe adjustment is calculated as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,Nine Months Ended\\nSeptember 30,\\n2023 2022 2023 2022\\nDGD operating cash flow data\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (28) $ 512 $ 487 $ 661 \\nExclude: Changes in current assets and current\\nliabilities  (192)  273  (408)  73 \\nAdjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities  164  239  895  588 \\nOther joint venture member’s ownership interest 50% 50% 50% 50%\\nDGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating\\nactivities attributable to the other joint venture\\nmember’s ownership interest in DGD $ 82 $ 119 $ 447 $ 294 \\n◦Capital investments attributable to Valero is defined as all capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and \\ncatalyst cost expenditures presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the portion of DGD’s \\ncapital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of VIEs other \\nthan DGD.\\nDGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to \\nfund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash \\nflow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed \\nto our net share of total capital investments. We also exclude the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we \\nconsolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an \\nimportant measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.\\n(f)The Refining segment regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: U.S. Gulf Coast - Corpus Christi East, \\nCorpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; \\nU.S. Mid Continent - Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; North Atlantic - Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; \\nand U.S. West Coast - Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.\\n(g)Primarily includes petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.\\n(h)Valero uses certain operating statistics (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and the accompanying earnings \\nrelease to evaluate performance between comparable periods. Different companies may calculate them in different ways.\\nAll per barrel of throughput, per gallon of sales, and per gallon of production amounts are calculated by dividing the \\nassociated dollar amount by the throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the period, as applicable.\\nThroughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput volumes per day, \\nsales volumes per day, and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables), respectively, by the \\nnumber of days in the applicable period. We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the \\nRefining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who \\noperate facilities similar to those included in our segments. We believe the use of such volumes results in per unit amounts \\nthat are most representative of the product margins generated and the operating costs incurred as a result of our operation of \\nthose facilities.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 20(i)The RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program. The RVO cost is \\ncalculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class \\nof renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the \\nquotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels \\nconsumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding \\ntogether the results of each calculation.VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION\\nNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (Continued)\\nTable Page 21\\n```\\n\"\n",
