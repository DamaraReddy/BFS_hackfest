      "4. Convert the value from million to billion by dividing it by 1000. In this case, $(5,942) million is equivalent to $5.942 billion.\n",

      " Unfortunately, the specific value for capital expenditure (capex) is not provided in the financial statements provided. Without the explicit disclosure of capex in the given information, it is not possible to calculate or determine the exact capital expenditure value. The extracted financial statements do not include a specific line item for capital expenditure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to obtain the capex value, it would be necessary to access the company's official financial statements, such as the balance sheet, statement of cash flows, or management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections, where capital expenditure details are typically disclosed. Alternatively, the company's annual report or filings with regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may contain the required information.\n",

      " To find or calculate the capital expenditure (capex) value, you would need to analyze the financial statements or notes provided in the report. Here are the steps to calculate capex:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Look for the relevant sections in the report that provide information about capital expenditure or investments in fixed assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Identify the specific line items or descriptions that indicate capital expenditure. For example, it may be mentioned as \"Purchases of property and equipment\" or \"Acquisition of fixed assets and intangibles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Locate the corresponding values for the identified line items in the report. The values are usually reported in millions or billions of US dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If the value is reported in millions, convert it to billions by dividing the value by 1,000. For example, if the value is reported as $6,819 million, divide it by 1,000 to get $6.819 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Record the calculated capex value in billions of US dollars.\n",
